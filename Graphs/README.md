## Algorithms

### Flood Fill

like the bucket tool in paint programs. 
1. Take the position of the starting point.
2. Decide wether you want to go in 4 directions (N, S, W, E) or 8 directions (N, S, W, E, NW, NE, SW, SE).
3. Choose a replacement color and a target color.
4. Travel in those directions.
5. If the tile you land on is a target, reaplce it with the chosen color.
6. Repeat 4 and 5 until youâ€™ve been everywhere within the boundaries.

### Topological Sort
only for directed acyclic graphs.

The topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph is nothing but the linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between node u and v(u -> v), node u appears before v in that ordering.

1. dfs on graph
2. maintain a stack. in each dfs call, after all the neighbouring nodes of the current node are visited, push current node to stack.
3. stack contains the topological ordering

- if a cycle exists in the graph, no topological ordering is possible so, to detect cycle in a DAG, can use topological sort.

- since a DAG has no cycle, it only contains finite paths. That means there is atleast one path of largest length. 



### Kahn's Algorithm
to find topological sort using BFS instead of DFS

1. maintain an indegree array such that indegree[i] = k means that indegree of node i is k.
2. first calculate indegree of each node and store in indegree array. 
3. push the node with indegree = 0 to the q. as you pop nodes from the q, add to the answer array.
4. continue with bfs on the node just pushed into the q, and decrease the indegree of each neighbouring node
5. push the node with indegree 0 into the q.

useful when we need to answer 2 questions - 
1. is it possible to have a topological ordering?
2. if yes then print out one of all the orders.

**Note** 
    - a DAG has at least one vertex with the indegree as zero and one vertex with outdegree as zero.

    - time complexity is O(V + E). 

**Code**
```Python
from collections import deque
def TopologicalSort(graph, n):
 
    # list to store the sorted elements
    L = []
 
    # get in-degree information of the graph
    indegree = graph.indegree
 
    # Set of all nodes with no incoming edges
    S = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegree[i] == 0])
 
    while S:
        # remove node `n` from `S`
        n = S.pop()
 
        # add `n` at the tail of `L`
        L.append(n)
 
        for m in graph.adjList[n]:
            # remove an edge from `n` to `m` from the graph
            indegree[m] = indegree[m] - 1
 
            # if `m` has no other incoming edges, insert `m` into `S`
            if indegree[m] == 0:
                S.append(m)
 
    # if a graph has edges, then the graph has at least one cycle
    for i in range(n):
        if indegree[i]:
            return None
 
    return L
```

### Disjoint Set (Union Find)
Resources 
- https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/disjoint-set-union-by-rank-union-by-size-path-compression-g-46/

Problem Statement - given 2 components of an undirected graph, find if node m and node n are in the same component or not

This can be solved by BFS/DFS (O(V + E)) too but by disjoint set, takes constant time (O(1))

Usually used for dynamic (or constantly changing graphs)

ADT Functionalities :
1. Find parent of a node
2. Union (add edge between 2 nodes) 
    - Union by Rank
    - Union by Size

**Union by Rank**
1. Rank - distance between node and furthest leaf node

2. Ultimate Parent - root node

**Algorithm**
1. init rank array with 0, init parent array with node value. parent[i] = i

2. find ultimate parent of u and v, let pu and pv.

3. find rank of pu and pv

4. connect ultimate parent with smaller rank to other ultimate parent with larger rank.

## Tips
1. DFS vs BFs

|DFS |BFS|
|---|---|
|exhaust all possibilities and check which is best (think dp)|shortest path from source to dest|
|count all paths b/w source and dest|if there exists a path b/w nodes|
||will give the shortest path. usually much more efficient to find shortest path|


2. in BFS, if you need to iterate levelwise and find shortest path, you need a for loop to iterate through the length of the q. eg - [link](OnlyBFSorDFS\wordLadder.py)

3. Equivalent definitions of a bipartite graph:

    - There is no cycle of odd length

    - we can split the nodes of the graph  into 2 subsets so that there is all the edges go from 1 subset to the other subset.

    - The graph should be bi-colourable.
