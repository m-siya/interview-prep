### Misra-Gries heavy hitters Algorithm
Given is a bag b of n elements and an integer k ≥ 2. Find the values that occur more than n ÷ k times in b. The Misra-Gries algorithm solves the problem by making two passes over the values in b, while storing at most k values from b and their number of occurrences during the course of the algorithm.
